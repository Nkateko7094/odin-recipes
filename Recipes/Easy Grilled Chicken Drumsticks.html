        Ingredients:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          4 chicken drumsticks
        </li>
        <li>
          olive oil as needed
        </li>
        <li>
          1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
        </li>
        <li>
          1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
        </li>
        salt and ground black pepper to taste
      </ul>

        <h2>
          Step 1:
        </h2>
        <li>
          Place chicken drumsticks into a resealable bag; add olive oil to coat. Add ranch dressing mix, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Squeeze out excess air, seal the bag, and toss to coat the drumsticks. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <h2>
          Step 2:
        </h2>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from the bag; discard marinade.
        </li>
        <h2>
          Step 3:
        </h2>
        <li>
          Cook on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into a drumstick reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the grill and let chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
